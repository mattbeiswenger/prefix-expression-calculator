# Installation
To run the JavaFX application, clone or download the project files. Navigate to the ```dist``` folder and open the ```.jar``` file.
If Java 7 or above is installed on your system, then a JavaFX GUI interface should appear asking to type a prefix expression. A prefix expression occurs when the operators precede the operands. Examples include:
- \+ 2 3
- \+ 4 * 9 3
- \- + \* / 10 2 6 8 3

**_Note that there must be a space between each operand and operator for the program to properly run_**
