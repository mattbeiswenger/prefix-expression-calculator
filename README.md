# Installation
To run the JavaFX application, clone or download the project files. Navigate to the ```dist``` folder and open .jar file.
If Java 7 or above is installed on your system then a JavaFX GUI interface should appear asking to type a prefix expression. A prefix expression occurs when the operators precede the operands. Examples include:
- + 2 3
- + 4 * 9 3
- * 2 - 1 1 / 4 5

**Note that there must be a space between each operand and operator for the program to properly run.
