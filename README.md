# prefix-expression-calculator
JavaFX application that computes prefix expressions, builds expression trees, and converts prefix expressions to infix using recursion

To run the JavaFX application, clone the project or download the project files. Navigate to the ```dist``` folder and open .jar file.
If Java 7 or above is installed on your system then a JavaFX GUI interface should appear asking to type a prefix expression. A prefix expression occurs when the operators precede the operands. Examples include:
- + 2 3

Note that there must be a space between each operand and operator for the program to properly run.
